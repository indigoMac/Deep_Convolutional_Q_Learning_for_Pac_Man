# Deep Convolutional Q-Learning for Pac-Man

This project demonstrates how to use Deep Convolutional Q-Learning to solve the Pac-Man problem, a classic game that serves as an excellent environment for reinforcement learning. The code is implemented in Python using the Gymnasium library for the environment and PyTorch for building the convolutional neural network.

## Key Features
- Implementation of the Deep Convolutional Q-Learning algorithm.
- Training and evaluation of the model in the Pac-Man environment.
- Visualization of the results and the agent's performance.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required packages. You can do this directly in your Jupyter Notebook or Colab environment.

```bash
!pip install gymnasium torch numpy matplotlib
